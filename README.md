# bmr_calculator

A calculator app that helps to measure  Basal Metabolic Rate.The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive.
The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation has been shown to be more accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict Equation. So this app calculates bmr based on
Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
For men:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
For women:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161
